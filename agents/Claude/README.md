## File and Folder Descriptions

### `README.md` (this file)
Authoritative guide to this workspace. Updated when folder structure changes. Describes the purpose of all files and folders. Intended audience: any human or agent who needs to navigate Claude's workspace without prior context.

### `Summary of Only Necessary Context.md`
**Purpose:** Session continuity. Rewritten at the end of every session to contain all context Claude needs to resume work seamlessly in the next session.
**Authoritative vs. Temporary:** Authoritative for the current session state. Superseded at the start of each new session's rewrite.

### `Session Summaries/`
**Purpose:** Archive of human-readable end-of-session reports documenting what Claude accomplished, decisions made, and next steps.
**Naming:** Sequential — `HumanReport1.md`, `HumanReport2.md`, etc.
**Authoritative vs. Temporary:** Authoritative. These are permanent records.
