# Phase 1 

**Date Started:** 2026-03-16


**Randy:**

Hello everyone! Let's go ahead and get started on Phase 1 of this project. Claude I am going to have you complete all the tasks for Phase 1 and then I will have Codex and Antigravitymake sure that everything is set up and working correctly. Once Codex, Antigravity and I explicitly approve we will move on to Phase 2. Thanks!

**Claude (Session 1):**

Hello Randy! Understood — I'll take ownership of Phase 1 and get everything set up. Here's what I'll be doing:

1. Creating the virtual environment at the project root (`venv/`)
2. Installing all required dependencies: `accusleepy`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`
3. Creating the root `.gitignore` (excludes `venv/`, OS artifacts, scratch files)
4. Creating `AccuSleePy_Demo/.gitignore` (excludes runtime artifacts only)
5. Generating `AccuSleePy_Demo/requirements.txt` with pinned package versions

I'll document everything thoroughly and note the gate-check status when complete. Codex and Antigravity — please verify the setup once I've finished and confirm all gate conditions are met before we proceed to Phase 2.

Phase 1 is complete. Here is the full gate checklist:

- [x] **Virtual environment created** at project root (`venv/`) using Python 3.11.9 — activated and working
- [x] **`accusleepy` importable** from the environment — confirmed with `import accusleepy`
- [x] **Root `.gitignore` present** — excludes `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, OS metadata (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`), IDE files, temp files, logs
- [x] **`AccuSleePy_Demo/.gitignore` present** — excludes only runtime artifacts (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.DS_Store`, etc.); intentionally does NOT ignore `outputs/`, `figures/`, `report/`, `QC_report.md`, or `low_confidence_epochs/`
- [x] **`AccuSleePy_Demo/requirements.txt` present** with all pinned versions (accusleepy==0.12.0, numpy==2.4.3, scipy==1.17.1, matplotlib==3.10.8, pandas==2.3.3, torch==2.10.0, and all transitive dependencies)

Additionally, the full `AccuSleePy_Demo/` directory scaffold has been created matching the deliverable structure from `Project Details.md`:
- `scripts/utils/` — ready for shared utility modules
- `outputs/predicted_labels/` — ready for Phase 3 outputs
- `figures/` subdirectories (hypnograms, stage_percentages, bout_analysis, validation, transitions)
- `low_confidence_epochs/`
- `report/`

**Codex and Antigravity:** Please verify the environment and file structure and confirm approval so we can proceed to Phase 2. Key things to check:
1. `venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "import accusleepy"` executes without error
2. Root `.gitignore` excludes `venv/` but not `AccuSleePy_Demo/`
3. `AccuSleePy_Demo/.gitignore` does NOT exclude `outputs/`, `figures/`, `report/`
4. `AccuSleePy_Demo/requirements.txt` has pinned versions for all packages

Thanks Claude! Codex and Antigravity I want you to pay special attention to make sure that you can use the virtual environment as all coding work must be done through it. I want each of you to test it yourselves. But also make sure everything else for Phase 1 is set up and working correctly.
