# Phase 1 

**Date Started:** 2026-03-16


**Randy:**

Hello everyone! Let's go ahead and get started on Phase 1 of this project. Claude I am going to have you complete all the tasks for Phase 1 and then I will have Codex and Antigravitymake sure that everything is set up and working correctly. Once Codex, Antigravity and I explicitly approve we will move on to Phase 2. Thanks!

**Claude (Session 1):**

Hello Randy! Understood — I'll take ownership of Phase 1 and get everything set up. Here's what I'll be doing:

1. Creating the virtual environment at the project root (`venv/`)
2. Installing all required dependencies: `accusleepy`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`
3. Creating the root `.gitignore` (excludes `venv/`, OS artifacts, scratch files)
4. Creating `AccuSleePy_Demo/.gitignore` (excludes runtime artifacts only)
5. Generating `AccuSleePy_Demo/requirements.txt` with pinned package versions

I'll document everything thoroughly and note the gate-check status when complete. Codex and Antigravity — please verify the setup once I've finished and confirm all gate conditions are met before we proceed to Phase 2.

**Claude (Session 1):**

Phase 1 is complete. Here is the full gate checklist:

- [x] **Virtual environment created** at project root (`venv/`) using Python 3.11.9 — activated and working
- [x] **`accusleepy` importable** from the environment — confirmed with `import accusleepy`
- [x] **Root `.gitignore` present** — excludes `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, OS metadata (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`), IDE files, temp files, logs
- [x] **`AccuSleePy_Demo/.gitignore` present** — excludes only runtime artifacts (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.DS_Store`, etc.); intentionally does NOT ignore `outputs/`, `figures/`, `report/`, `QC_report.md`, or `low_confidence_epochs/`
- [x] **`AccuSleePy_Demo/requirements.txt` present** with all pinned versions (accusleepy==0.12.0, numpy==2.4.3, scipy==1.17.1, matplotlib==3.10.8, pandas==2.3.3, torch==2.10.0, and all transitive dependencies)

Additionally, the full `AccuSleePy_Demo/` directory scaffold has been created matching the deliverable structure from `Project Details.md`:
- `scripts/utils/` — ready for shared utility modules
- `outputs/predicted_labels/` — ready for Phase 3 outputs
- `figures/` subdirectories (hypnograms, stage_percentages, bout_analysis, validation, transitions)
- `low_confidence_epochs/`
- `report/`

**Codex and Antigravity:** Please verify the environment and file structure and confirm approval so we can proceed to Phase 2. Key things to check:
1. `venv/Scripts/python.exe -c "import accusleepy"` executes without error
2. Root `.gitignore` excludes `venv/` but not `AccuSleePy_Demo/`
3. `AccuSleePy_Demo/.gitignore` does NOT exclude `outputs/`, `figures/`, `report/`
4. `AccuSleePy_Demo/requirements.txt` has pinned versions for all packages

**Randy:**

Thanks Claude! Codex and Antigravity I want you to pay special attention to make sure that you can use the virtual environment as all coding work must be done through it. I want each of you to test it yourselves. But also make sure everything else for Phase 1 is set up and working correctly.

---

**Codex (Session 1):**

I verified Phase 1 from the project root using the shared virtual environment and the current repository files.

Checks performed:
- `venv\Scripts\python.exe` imports `accusleepy` successfully
- AccuSleePy resolves to version `0.12.0` via `importlib.metadata.version("accusleepy")`
- The module does not expose `accusleepy.__version__`, so package metadata is the reliable version check
- Root `.gitignore` ignores `venv/` and does not ignore the deliverable folder
- `AccuSleePy_Demo/.gitignore` is limited to runtime artifacts and does not exclude deliverable outputs
- `AccuSleePy_Demo/requirements.txt` contains pinned package versions, including `accusleepy==0.12.0`
- The expected Phase 1 scaffold exists under `AccuSleePy_Demo/`, including `scripts/utils/`, `outputs/predicted_labels/`, all figure subdirectories, `low_confidence_epochs/`, and `report/`

Result:
- Codex approves Phase 1 as correctly set up and usable from the shared virtual environment.
- I do not see a Phase 1 blocker from my side.

**Antigravity (Session 1):**

I have also verified the Phase 1 setup from the shared virtual environment.

Checks performed:
- Executed `venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import accusleepy"` which executed successfully.
- Verified the root `.gitignore` correctly ignores `venv/` and IDE files without ignoring `AccuSleePy_Demo/`.
- Verified `AccuSleePy_Demo/.gitignore` correctly ignores runtime artifacts while keeping output payload directories versioned.
- Confirmed `AccuSleePy_Demo/requirements.txt` correctly pins dependencies, including `accusleepy==0.12.0`.
- Checked the `AccuSleePy_Demo/` folder structure, which correctly contains all required directories (outputs, figures, report, low_confidence_epochs, scripts).

Result:
- Antigravity approves Phase 1 as correctly set up.
- All gate conditions are met. We are ready to proceed to Phase 2.

**Randy:**

Thanks everyone! I also approve Phase 1. Let's move on to Phase 2. The next agent should conclude this chat.
